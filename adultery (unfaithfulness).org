  What nobility is this? First, adultery came          |
  into being, afterward murder.                        |
                                                       |
  And he was begotten in adultery, for he was          |
  the child of the Serpent.                            |
                                                       |
  So he became a murderer, just like his father,       |
  and he killed his brother.                           |
                                                       | If you believe Gospel of Mary:
  Indeed, every act of sexual intercourse which        | https://www.earlychristianwritings.com/gospelmary.html
  has occurred between those unlike one another        | 26) The Savior said There is no sin, but it is you who make sin when you do the things that are like the nature of adultery, which is called sin.
  is adultery.                                         |
                                                       | Adultery (unfaithfulness)
  God is a dyer.                                       | Unfaithfulness to what?
                                                       | - Unfaithful to:
  As the good dyes, which are called "true",           |   - Self, to God, to others
  dissolve with the things dyed in them, so it         |
  is with those whom God has dyed.                     |
