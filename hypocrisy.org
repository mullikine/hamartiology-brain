We are so quick to highlight other sins like
fornication lying stealing sexual immorality
but laziness is glossed over laziness is
ignored.

The reason is this:
- Sexuality is one of those issues where it is easy to pass judgement on another because you personally do not have the same type of sexual attraction and cannot understand it.
  - Sexuality is one of those things which is not easily able to be understood with empathy. Finding a sexual partner is a highly personalised endeavour and for some people their match might be extremely rare. They will surely face discrimination.

It is possible there is a demon or fallen
angel which has created in the world the
trap/red herring for Christians to focus on
this one area of sin.

Let's say God allows an evil spirit to confuse a person regarding sexual sin and that person is deceived, but has no knowledge that they are being confused. What difference in judgement then would there be compared with a person who has no such evil spirit but is in love with their own sin in a different area?
