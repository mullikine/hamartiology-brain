If you're being unfaithful it's evil
certainly.

But the world will try to make you feel evil
for the purpose of distracting you from what
is truly evil.

If you are being unfaithful, whether that is
to your spouse or to God, that is evil.

What goes in does not defile you - what comes
out does.

Porn is evil if you progressively increase the
strangeness of it or degenerate.

If you're saved you begin to eliminate things
which prevent you from being faithful to God
and to others.

If porn is causing you to sin then you'll
remove it.

Sin is damaging relationship with God.

Don't separate the concept of sin from the
concept of a relationship with God.
