  11 Dearly beloved, I beseech you as strangers and pilgrims, abstain from fleshly lusts, which war against the soul; 
  
  12 Having your conversation honest among the Gentiles: that, whereas they speak against you as evildoers, they may by
  your good works, which they shall behold, glorify God in the day of visitation. 
  
  13 Submit yourselves to every ordinance of man for the Lord's sake: whether it be to the king, as supreme; 
  
  14 Or unto governors, as unto them that are sent by him for the punishment of evildoers, and for the praise of them that
  do well.
