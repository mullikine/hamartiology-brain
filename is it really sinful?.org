  pride
      One sense of the word 'pride' is exalting
      thyself.
  
      The word 'pride' has too wide a semantic
      demain to be called a sin. Conceit, most
      centainly.
  
      Some senses of pride are not sinful:
      “I have the highest confidence in you, and
      I take great pride in you. You have
      greatly encouraged me and made me happy
      despite all our troubles” (2 Corinthians
      7:4, NLT).

Lust, obsession etc. may be created in an attempt to rectify injustice and eliminate falsehood.
For example, desire may be innocent, and then portrayed as sinful.
Yet it was not sinful.
And that person was duped into believing they were sinful because the other person pushed some insecurity onto them or false belief.
If that person realises they have been duped (perhaps it takes years), then they person try to prove that it wasn't sinful, that it was true and innocent.
Do I believe there is such thing as innocent desire?
