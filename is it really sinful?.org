Lust, obsession etc. may be created in an attempt to rectify injustice and eliminate falsehood.
For example, desire may be innocent, and then portrayed as sinful.
Yet it was not sinful.
And that person was duped into believing they were sinful because the other person pushed some insecurity onto them or false belief.
Then a person wants to prove that it wasn't sinful, that it was true and innocent.
Do I believe there is such thing as innocent desire?
